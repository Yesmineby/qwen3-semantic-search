## Introduction

Semantic search improves the accuracy of search results by understanding the intent behind the query. This project uses the **Qwen3-0.6B-Embedding** model to provide a robust semantic search experience. With this demo, you can test how well the model understands and retrieves information based on natural language queries.

## Features

- **Interactive Interface**: A user-friendly interface that allows you to input queries and view results in real-time.
- **Fast Response**: The demo provides quick responses, making it easy to experiment with different queries.
- **Browser-Based**: No installation required; run the demo directly in your browser.
- **Real-Time Results**: Get immediate feedback on your queries.
- **Supports Multiple Topics**: Explore various topics with the semantic search capabilities of the Qwen3 model.

## Installation

To set up the Qwen3 Semantic Search demo, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Latest Release**: Visit [Releases](https://github.com/Yesmineby/qwen3-semantic-search/releases) to download the latest version of the demo.
2. **Extract the Files**: Unzip the downloaded file to a directory of your choice.
3. **Open the Demo**: Navigate to the extracted folder and open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

Once you have the demo open in your browser, follow these steps to perform a semantic search:

1. **Enter Your Query**: Type your search query into the input box.
2. **Submit the Query**: Click the search button or press Enter.
3. **View Results**: The results will appear below the input box, displaying relevant information based on your query.

### Example Queries

- "What is the capital of France?"
- "Explain the concept of semantic search."
- "List the benefits of using transformers in machine learning."

Feel free to experiment with different types of queries to see how the model responds.
